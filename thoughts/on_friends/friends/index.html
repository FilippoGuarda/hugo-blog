		<p>Last month I saw a post on Instagram from someone I know who was complaining that their therapist, instead of listening and agreeing with everything they said, dared to suggest a solution to their problem.</p>
<p>What they were complaining about was that a professional who is paid to, if not solve, then at least manage the psychological (not psychiatric, which is a different thing) problems of their patients, was actually trying to help instead of playing along.</p>
<p>One issue I think is at stake here is that many people have come to see their therapist as a friend to vent to in times of need.
But you don&rsquo;t pay a friend. You talk to them and then you listen to them. It&rsquo;s a two-way relationship based on effort on both sides. Everybody carries some weight and it&rsquo;s not always easy to take on the burden of someone else&rsquo;s life.
But you do it because you care about them, and deep down you hope they care about you.</p>
<p>But what happens if you don&rsquo;t want to make the effort to build deep relationships with people based on trust and mutual support?
Enter the therapist, friend for the evening, for an affordable (yes, right) fee.
Does this remind you of anything?
Because love and friendship are both based on mutual effort, and if you can&rsquo;t get it from someone else, you pay for it.
Which is a bit sad.</p>
