![author's picture](/about/dither_profile.png)

I am Filippo Guarda, an automation engineer and a PhD student in systems engineering with a passion for robotics, stand-up comedy and outdoor activities.

In my academic and working life I acquired experience with several tools, programming languages and frameworks, some of these are: **ROS/ROS2**, **Python**, **C++** and **Open3D**.  

I made this little static blog to share some of my thoughts and to present myself and my work.
Have fun!.
