I am Filippo Guarda, an automation engineer with a passion for robotics, stand-up comedy and outdoor activities.

In my academic and working life I acquired experience with several tools, programming languages and frameworks, some of these are: **ROS/ROS2**, **Python**, **C++** and **Automation Studio**.  

While in the process of learning **Go**, I discovered Hugo: a golang-based static website generator. I felt the urge to create a personal blog.  
Here it is, have fun.
