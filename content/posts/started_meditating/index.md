As the title states, this is not the first time I am doing this.

The first time I really got into meditation was during high school, in a last ditch attempt to avoid very permanent solutions to my mental instability.  
School in italy is already really difficult for normal kids (1 IN 5 teens [report self harm or suicidal ideation](https://www.insalutenews.it/in-salute/autolesionismo-e-suicidio-adolescenziale-colpisce-1-giovane-su-5-serve-una-cultura-del-dialogo/)), then add in very religious parents and you're left with a not particularly appealing shit sandwitch you have to deal with, mostly on your own.
And, for a period, it worked.

Then I started university, went living on my own, got distracted by life and stopped.  
I thought I didn't really need it anymore, and in a certain sense it was true, I was not in the same space as I was at 16: yes, I joked about killing myself every now and then but I wasn't really _thinking_ about doing it.
