I started working on this blog in August 2022, after a particularly underwhelming exam session. 
Even if I was on holiday, the feeling of guilt resulting from not being able to learn my classes' study topics in a timely manner made it impossible to truly relax. Whatever I did, it felt like time wasted on unproductive things.  
I needed to demonstrate to myself that I could be productive, that I wasn't a slob and that I was able to learn things quickly enough.  
I was also contemplating the idea of making a personal website. 

The web from the 90's always fascinated me, even if I could not experience it first person (I was still sucking my thumb at the time). 
I love the idea of a patchwork of cobbled together personal websites, it seems like a modern-day wild west (I am aware of the dark web, but that's not as accessible and I'd rather stay out of any combination-of-letters-agency's list) compared to the modern monoliths that dominate online traffic.  
The indie web was a cool thing to think about, something that I wanted to be a part of. If not for the sheer commodity of directly owning my content, just for the flair of it. 

These are the circumstances that made me take the decision of building my personal blog, without previuos experience in anything web-related. It wasn't a smart move, but in this case a decision taken on a whim has had very satisfying results. 

## How the blog is made
The first thing I had to learn was how a website worked. I had a vague idea of front-end and back-end dynamics, but I was clueless about hosting, deploying, and actually building a website.  

The first impact was quite frightening to be honest; I had underestimated the complexity of the web, and after a couple hours investigating databases, stacks and web services, it was clear I was underequipped for the task.  
Corners had to be cut, hopefully not too many.

I needed an easy solution for a difficult problem, which usually comes with not solving the problem at all. Fortunately, while browsing youtube (something I started this project with the specific purpose of doing _less_ of) my attention was caught by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I) recently posted by Luke Smith, a libre-web evangelist and the creator of [landchad.net](https://landchad.net/), which converted me almost instantly to HUGO.
