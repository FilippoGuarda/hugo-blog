# Automagically dithering with Hugo render hooks

You have no idea how frustrating it was to dither this single f\*\*\*ing image. 
But now the next whatever ones it will be will do that in _zero_ time.

I selected a slice of muted colors that I am using to bin all colors in an image, I wanted that retro look I found in old manuals from the 60's.

Admittedly, it does not work too well on bright images, but it's not too bad for a full 16 colors (including black and white).
